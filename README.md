We start this project in lab 6 and we used the functions and objects
and in the lab 7 we learned about the constructor functions and that help us to make the first code easier and flexable so we don't need to change too much content to add a new object, in addition we make the methods outside the objects by prototype and that will help us to save the memory.
in lab 8 we had a recap for the CSS and we add some styling to our code to make it look better.
